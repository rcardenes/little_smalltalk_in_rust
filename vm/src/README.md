# Little Smalltalk

Rust implementation of the Little Smalltalk virtual machine, originally created by
Timothy Budd in 1980s. This implementation is based on the original design, but with
some modifications to fit the Rust programming language. There are differences as well
in the way the VM's memory is managed.

The implementation has been guided by the "A Little Smalltalk"[1] book.
